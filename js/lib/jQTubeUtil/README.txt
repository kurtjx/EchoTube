This plugin was created to simplify searching youtube into 
wrapper functions with callbacks that can handle the responses.

There are a fair amount of details written in the non-minified version of the
jQTubeUtil plugin, that are work looking at if this is your first time.

If you have any questions, suggestions and/or find bugs, please feel free to email me
at ntikku@gmail.com or find me on twitter @ntikku.

Enjoy!
